## Introduction

The Web Calculator is a user-friendly tool designed to perform basic mathematical operations. It's a convenient way to quickly calculate arithmetic problems without the need for a physical calculator or complex software. This project is aimed at showcasing my web development skills while providing a functional utility.

## Features

1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** The calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

2. **User-Friendly Interface:** The interface is clean and intuitive, making it easy for users of all levels to input and calculate numbers.

3. **Responsive Design:** The calculator is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

4. **Real-Time Calculation:** Results are updated in real-time as users input their numbers and select operations.

5. **Clear Display:** The calculator displays both the input expression and the calculated result for better user understanding.

## Technologies Used

The Web Calculator is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML5:** Provides the structure and layout for the calculator interface.
- **CSS3:** Styles the calculator interface, ensuring a visually appealing design.
- **JavaScript:** Handles user input, calculations, and real-time updates of the display.

## Usage

1. Visit the [Calculator Link](https://www.example.com/calculator) to access the web calculator.

2. Input your numbers by clicking on the buttons.

3. Click on the operation button (+, -, *, /) to select the desired mathematical operation.

4. The result will be displayed instantly on the screen.

5. To perform another calculation, simply clear the input or start a new calculation.

## Future Enhancements

This project is just the beginning. I have plans to expand the calculator's functionality and add more advanced features, such as support for decimals, percentage calculations, and a memory feature.
